    <h2>Why Security Matters</h2>
    <p>Mobile applications handle sensitive user data, making security a top priority for developers. A single security vulnerability can compromise user trust and lead to significant financial and reputational damage.</p>
    
    <h2>Essential Security Practices</h2>
    <h3>Data Encryption</h3>
    <p>Always encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Use industry-standard encryption algorithms and properly manage encryption keys.</p>
    
    <h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>
    <p>Implement strong authentication mechanisms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</li>
      <li>Biometric authentication</li>
      <li>OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect</li>
      <li>JWT tokens with proper expiration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Secure API Communication</h3>
    <p>Ensure all API communications use HTTPS and implement proper API security measures including rate limiting and input validation.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Be aware of and protect against common mobile app vulnerabilities such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insecure data storage</li>
      <li>Weak server-side controls</li>
      <li>Insufficient transport layer protection</li>
      <li>Poor session management</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Security Testing</h2>
    <p>Regular security testing should be an integral part of your development process. This includes penetration testing, code reviews, and automated security scanning.</p>
