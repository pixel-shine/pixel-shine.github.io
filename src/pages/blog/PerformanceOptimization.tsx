    <h2>Why Performance Matters</h2>
    <p>App performance directly impacts user experience and retention. Studies show that users expect apps to load in under 3 seconds, and performance issues are one of the top reasons for app uninstalls.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Performance Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Launch Time:</strong> Time from tap to usable interface</li>
      <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> Time for the app to respond to user input</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> RAM consumption during app operation</li>
      <li><strong>Battery Consumption:</strong> Impact on device battery life</li>
      <li><strong>Network Efficiency:</strong> Data usage and transfer speed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Optimization Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Code Optimization</h3>
    <p>Write efficient code by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoiding memory leaks</li>
      <li>Using appropriate data structures</li>
      <li>Implementing lazy loading</li>
      <li>Minimizing DOM manipulations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Image and Asset Optimization</h3>
    <p>Optimize images and assets by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using appropriate file formats (WebP, AVIF)</li>
      <li>Implementing responsive images</li>
      <li>Compressing assets without quality loss</li>
      <li>Using CDNs for faster delivery</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Caching Strategies</h3>
    <p>Implement effective caching mechanisms to reduce load times and improve offline functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>Monitoring and Testing</h2>
    <p>Use performance monitoring tools to track key metrics and identify bottlenecks. Regular performance testing should be part of your development workflow.</p>
    
    <h2>Platform-Specific Optimizations</h2>
    <h3>iOS Optimization</h3>
    <p>Leverage iOS-specific features like Core Data optimization and efficient use of Auto Layout.</p>
    
    <h3>Android Optimization</h3>
    <p>Optimize for Android by managing background processes efficiently and using appropriate threading strategies.</p>
